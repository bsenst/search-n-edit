Concerns and recommendations#Statistical information#7.	The Committee welcomes the carrying out, in 2011, of a national housing and population census that, for the first time, included an ethno-racial variable, which was based on self-identification; as a result, more complete information would be available on the State party’s demographic composition. 
8#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.	Concerns and recommendations#Statistical information#8.	While the Committee welcomes the efforts made to include an ethno-racial variable in the data gathered, it is concerned that this is not done routinely and that some government offices do not use the variable when gathering their data, thereby impeding the generation of reliable data and indicators that could provide a clear and objective picture of the needs of all segments of the population. The Committee regrets that the State party did not provide sufficient data and indicators concerning persons of indigenous origin and other minority groups (arts. 1 and 2).
9#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.	Concerns and recommendations#Legislative measures #9.	Bearing in mind its general recommendation No. 4 (1973) concerning reporting by States parties, which refers to the demographic composition of the population, and its earlier recommendation (CERD/C/URY/CO/16-20, para. 8), the Committee urges the State party to continue to promote the systematic collection of data and urges the government offices concerned to include an ethno-racial variable in their compilations of data. The Committee requests the State party to include reliable, up-to-date and complete statistical data in its next report on the demographic composition of its population, as well as human rights and socioeconomic indicators broken down by race, colour, descent and national or ethnic origin and then by gender, age, region and location (urban vs. rural), including for its most remote areas. 
10#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.	Concerns and recommendations#Legislative measures #10.	The Committee reiterates its concern at the absence of any legal provision that explicitly prohibits racial discrimination. In addition, the Committee notes with concern that, contrary to the provisions of article 4 (a) and (b) of the Convention, the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred and propaganda or participation in organizations that promote racial discrimination are not defined as punishable acts under the Uruguayan Criminal Code (arts. 1, 2 and 4).
11#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.	Concerns and recommendations#Policy on combating racial discrimination #11.	The Committee reiterates its earlier recommendation (CERD/C/URY/CO/16-20, para. 9) and urges the State party to include in its legislation a clear and explicit prohibition against racial discrimination that meets all the requirements established in article 1 (1) of the Convention and that covers acts of direct and indirect discrimination in all spheres of the law and of public life. In addition, in the light of its general recommendation No. 7 (1985) relating to the implementation of article 4, which refers to legislation to eradicate racial discrimination, and general recommendation No. 15 (1993) on article 4 of the Convention, the Committee recommends that the State party amend its Criminal Code to bring the provisions relating to racial discrimination into line with article 4 of the Convention, inasmuch as the latter is not applied directly and bearing in mind its general recommendation No. 35 (2013) on combating racist hate speech. The Committee further recommends that the State party ensure that motives based on race or on skin colour, descent or national or ethnic origin are considered as an aggravating circumstance when imposing punishment for a crime. 
12#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.

The Committee regrets that the State party has not implemented its earlier recommendation (CERD/C/URY/CO/16-20, para. 11) that the State party adopt the National Plan against Racism and Discrimination.

13#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination#Concluding observations on the combined twenty-first to twenty-third periodic reports of Uruguay* #C.	Concerns and recommendations#Institutional measures#13.	The Committee urges the State party to formulate a comprehensive national policy on combating racial discrimination that includes the adoption of a national plan against racism and discrimination, ensuring that the stages of formulation and implementation both include effective participation by persons of African descent, persons of indigenous origin and persons belonging to other minority groups who continue to be victims of discrimination and social exclusion. The Committee further recommends that the State party ensure the allocation of the necessary human, technical and financial resources for effective implementation of the policy throughout the territory of the State party.

While taking note of the information provided by the delegation on the establishment of a working group on ethnic and racial policies whose membership comprises existing bodies for racial equality, the Committee is concerned by the incompleteness of the information concerning the working group’s functions and the possible overlapping of functions with the Honorary Commission against Racism, Xenophobia and All Other Forms of Discrimination (art. 2).

In this regard, the Committee recommends that the State party clearly define the functions of the working group on ethno-racial policies so as to prevent any overlapping of functions with the Honorary Commission against Racism, Xenophobia and All Other Forms of Discrimination. The Committee urges the State party to ensure that adequate financial, technical and human resources are allocated for those mechanisms to operate effectively.

Concerns and recommendations#Political rights #18.	The Committee notes with concern the lack of effective measures to promote political participation by Uruguayans of African descent, which is reflected in underrepresentation of Afro-Uruguayans at all levels of government. It is concerned as well that, according to information received, only 0.8 per cent of decision-making positions in the public and the private sectors are occupied by persons of African descent (art. 5 (c)).

The Committee remains concerned by the multiple forms of discrimination to which Afro-Uruguayan women are subjected, in particular in the areas of education, employment and health.

Concerns and recommendations#Access to justice #33.	The Committee notes with concern the absence of court cases and sentences handed down for acts relating to racial discrimination; that could be the result, partly, of insufficient specialized, routine training of civil servants and members of the police in application of the provisions of the Convention, as well as victims’ unfamiliarity with the legal system.
